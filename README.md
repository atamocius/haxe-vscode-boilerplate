# haxe-vscode-boilerplate

A barebones boilerplate for Haxe in VS Code

## Debugging

This boilerplate includes launch configurations for debugging with the following debuggers:

- Node
- Flash

### Node

VS Code already has built-in support for debugging with Node. Just make sure to install the [Node JS runtime](https://nodejs.org).

### Flash

You need to have the [Flash Debugger plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vshaxe.haxe-debug) for VS Code installed.
